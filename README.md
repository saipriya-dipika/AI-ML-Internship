# AI-ML Internship
## Performance Monitoring and Analytics for Aero-Gas Turbine Engines

### Abstract
This project Utilizes a custom Python application, that processes thousands of data points per run, tracking module-specific parameters and fixed sensors to identify trends, stagnation, erratic readings, sensor malfunctions, and anomalies. With the help of the Mistral-7B language model, the analysis generates precise textual insights, enabling the detection of critical issues that could affect engine reliability. The application supports comparative analysis across multiple runs, handling up to 20,000 data points to uncover subtle performance shifts. Through clear visualizations and structured findings, the report provides actionable recommendations for maintenance and operational decisions, ensuring the safety and efficiency of aerospace systems.
