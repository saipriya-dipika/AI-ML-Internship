# AI-ML Internship
## Performance Monitoring and Analytics for Aero-Gas Turbine Engines

### Abstract
This project focuses on building a visualization and analytics tool that directly processes data from a structured database, removing the need for manual extraction or intermediate files. Users will interact with a GUI-based system to select parameters for visualizing trends and patterns. In the next phase, a Generative AI model, will compare visualizations with predefined insights and generate conclusions based on detected trends. The system will also support natural language queries, allowing users to request specific graphs/queries, compare performance trends, identify similar performance patterns, and extract relevant data insights. By automating visualization and analysis, this tool aims to improve efficiency and decision-making in performance monitoring.
